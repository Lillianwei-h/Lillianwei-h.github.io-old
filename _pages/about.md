Hi! I'm Siwei Han(韩偲蔚), a senior at Fudan University, Computer Science and Technology Department. I am interested in alignment and application of LLMs, VLMs and multimodal models, currently interning in [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io)'s team at UNC.

In this paper, we propose a novel comparison-based CoT generation algorithm that directly identifies the most promising thoughts with the noisy feedback from the LLM. In each round, we randomly pair intermediate thoughts and directly prompt the LLM to select the more promising one from each pair, allowing us to identify the most promising thoughts through an iterative process. To further model the noise in the comparison, we resort to the techniques of ensemble and dueling bandits and propose two variants of the proposed algorithm.

# 💻 Projects
### [LLMEVAL - Fudan University’s NLP Laboratory](http://www.llmeval.com/) Apr. 2023 - Jun. 2023
Designing questions and evaluation criteria for assessing large language models such as GPT 4.0, GPT
3.5, and New Bing. Also participated in subsequent data organization tasks.

### [THSH shell](https://github.com/Lillianwei-h/Comp-530/tree/lab1) Oct. 2023
This shell can run standard linux shell commands. It also supports creating new built-in commands. It
includes features like pipelines, input/output redirection, script input, and debugging.

### [LLM Reviser](https://github.com/Lillianwei-h/weak_aligner) Mar. 2024 - Jun. 2024
<img src="../images/revisor.png" alt="revisor" style="zoom:20%; " /> Leverage a reviser model to enhance the quality of the response from the original LLM and further preference tuning the LLM with the LLM-generated responses as dispreferred answers and the revised answers as preferred answers.
