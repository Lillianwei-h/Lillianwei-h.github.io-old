Hi! I'm Siwei Han(韩偲蔚), a senior at Fudan University, Computer Science and Technology Department. I am interested in alignment and application of LLMs, VLMs and multimodal models, currently interning in [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io)'s team at UNC.

In this paper, we propose a novel comparison-based CoT generation algorithm that directly identifies the most promising thoughts with the noisy feedback from the LLM. In each round, we randomly pair intermediate thoughts and directly prompt the LLM to select the more promising one from each pair, allowing us to identify the most promising thoughts through an iterative process. To further model the noise in the comparison, we resort to the techniques of ensemble and dueling bandits and propose two variants of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we introduce MMIE, a robust, knowledge-intensive benchmark to evaluate interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in LVLMs. With 20K+ examples covering 12 fields and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. We publicly release our benchmark and code on [MMIE](https://mmie-bench.github.io).

# 💻 Projects
### [LLM Reviser](https://github.com/Lillianwei-h/weak_aligner) Mar. 2024 - Jun. 2024
Leverage a reviser model to enhance the quality of the response from the original LLM and further preference tuning the LLM with the LLM-generated responses as dispreferred answers and the revised answers as preferred answers.
